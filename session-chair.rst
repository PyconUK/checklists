Session Chair Checklist
=======================

* If possible, before your session try to meet or email the speakers who you'll be supporting and say "hi". Check they:
 * tell you about any special requirements they may have;
 * have the correct projector dongle for their laptop (input is standard VGA);
 * they understand what time and place their talk will be (seriously). ;-)
* Immediately before your session ensure the projector (and any audio equipment) is working. In case of problems find a member of the organising committee (try the front desk first).
* Talks + questions should last no longer than their alloted time. See the schedule for detail (http://www.pyconuk.org/schedule/)
* Tell the speaker that you'll give them a 10 and 5 minute warning before they run out of time (we'll provide A4 sheets of paper to hold up saying 10mins/5mins).
* Make sure the talk starts at the advertised time. If the speaker isn't there, find a member of the organising committee (try the front desk first).
* Please make sure you introduce the speaker ("Next up we have Fred Bloggs talking about "Python all the things" is entirely appropriate.)
* If they or the questions get to the end of the allowed time, use tact to stop them. ;-)
* If there is no time for questions, say so and ask interested parties to grab the speaker in the corridor.
* Thank the speaker at the end.
* Have fun (tell a joke)!
